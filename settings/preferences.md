!!!light
This preference is applicable only for the web app. It has no effect on the mobile app.
!!!

When this setting is turned on, pressing enter key while composing a new message or replying to a message will send the message instead of adding a line break in the message.

### Auto archive default

Set a default value for the auto archive setting. When on, customer messages are archived as soon as a reply is sent. You can also turn auto archive on or off, for a particular conversation, at the time of sending a reply.

### Profile bar default tab

Profile bar is what you see on the right most side of the screen when viewing a conversation (i.e. sender's profile, notes, and follow-ups). You can select which tab should be opened by default for your team.

#### Available options

1. Profile tab
2. Notes tab
3. Follow-ups tab

### Follow-ups tab preferences

These are additional preferences for the *Follow-ups* tab.

#### Open new follow-up form automatically when the follow-ups tab is opened

When this setting is turned *on*, instead of showing follow-ups for a conversation by default, it opens a new follow-up reminder form. This makes it very convenient for your team to add new follow-up reminders.

Given you already receive a reminder in the inbox on the follow-up due date, and also there is a separate page for viewing upcoming and past follow-ups, **keeping this setting *on* is recommended**.

#### Default tags for the new follow-up form

If there are tags you use frequently for new follow-up reminders (e.g. leads), adding them here would always auto-populate them when a new follow-up reminder form is opened.
