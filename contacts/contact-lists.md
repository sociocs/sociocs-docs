## "All contacts" list

Your account already comes with a default contact list named "*All contacts*". You can create additional contact lists to group different contacts as per your needs.

"*All contacts*" is a special list which has all the contacts directly added to this list, as well as contacts added to any other list.

## Create a contact list

{{include "go-to-contacts"}}

- Click on "*Create a new list*".

- Enter "*List name*", and click "*Submit*".

## Rename a contact list

{{include "go-to-contacts"}}

- Click on the contact list you would like to rename.

- Click on the ![edit](https://static.sociocs.com/icons-docs/pencil.svg) button on the top right.

- Enter a new "*List name*", and click "*Submit*".

## Delete a contact list

{{include "go-to-contacts"}}

- Click on the contact list you would like to delete.

- Click on the ![delete](https://static.sociocs.com/icons-docs/trash-can.svg) button on the top right.

- Click "*Confirm*".

### Delete caveats

#### When deleting "All contacts" list

It doesn't delete the "*All contacts*" list itself. It actually deletes all the contacts within the list. If a contact also belongs to any other list, it gets deleted from that other list as well.

#### When deleting a list you created

It deletes the contact list along with all the contacts within the list. If a contact also belongs to any other list, it still stays in that list as well as in the"*All contacts*" list.
