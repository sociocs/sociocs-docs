1. By default Webflow adds "*Name*" and "*Email address*" fields in the form. **Email address is required for the form to work correctly in Sociocs.**

1. In the field settings, go to "*Element Settings*". In "*Text Fields Settings -> Name*", change value for the "*Name*" to "name" and for the "*Email Address*" field to "email" in lowercase. **These field names MUST be exactly as mentioned and in lowercase.**

1. Add additional fields you would like to capture (e.g. "*Message*"). Unlike "*Name*", and "*Email Address*" fields, you can name these additional fields whatever you like.
