## Introduction

Sociocs Web Chat plugin adds a chat bubble on your website that draw user's attention, and gives them an easy way to reach out to you. It converts an inquiry into SMS / text messaging based conversation, so that your user doesn't have to wait on the website for a response.

When your web app user initiates the inquiry, it shows up in your Sociocs Inbox, from where you can reply to the user, and continue the conversation.
